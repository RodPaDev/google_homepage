In this project I have to recreate google's homepage look

Skills I need:

Create forms/input

Fetch external image

Identify external background color

Identify external fonts used

how tu use classes with css

apply css code to html code

How I did it:

I devided the page with grids into 6 sections

3 rows 3 columns

Google Image and input is in the main section

to center the buttons I also added a grid with 2 rows

I used google's own system to make the search by naming the text input "q"

and giving the feeling lucky button the name of "btnI"
